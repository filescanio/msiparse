# MSI Installation Workflow Analysis

## Understanding the Windows Installer Process

The Microsoft Windows Installer (MSI) is a software component and application programming interface (API) of Microsoft Windows that is used for the installation, maintenance, and removal of software. MSI files are actually databases that contain all the instructions and data required for a product installation.

## Installation Process Overview

When an MSI package is executed, the Windows Installer service orchestrates a sophisticated installation process that consists of several distinct phases:

### 1. User Interface Sequence

The UI Sequence is defined in the `InstallUISequence` table and is responsible for:

- Gathering user input (installation location, feature selection)
- Displaying license agreements
- Showing progress during installation
- Collecting user information
- Performing prerequisite checks

**Security Note**: The UI sequence generally does not perform system modifications. Its primary purpose is to prepare for the Execute sequence.

### 2. Execute Sequence

The Execute Sequence is defined in the `InstallExecuteSequence` table and contains the actions that perform actual system changes. It operates in two modes:

1. **Immediate Mode**: 
   - Initial phase where the Windows Installer analyzes what needs to be done
   - Generates an internal script of actions to be performed
   - Immediate mode actions run with user privileges

2. **Deferred Mode**: 
   - Executes the generated script of actions
   - Performs the actual system changes (file copies, registry modifications)
   - Runs with elevated privileges (if available)
   - Contains rollback actions for error recovery

## Key Tables Controlling the Installation Flow

### InstallExecuteSequence Table

This table defines the ordered list of actions to perform during installation:

| Column | Description | Security Relevance |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Action | Name of built-in or custom action | Identifies what operations are performed |
| Condition | Boolean expression determining if action runs | Can hide malicious actions in certain environments |
| Sequence | Number defining execution order | Reveals when critical operations happen |

### CustomAction Table

This table defines any custom code that will execute during installation:

| Column | Description | Security Relevance |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Action | Identifier for the custom action | Referenced by sequence tables |
| Type | Integer value defining behavior | Indicates privilege level and execution method |
| Source | Location of code/data to execute | Can point to embedded code or system files |
| Target | Parameters for execution | May contain commands or script code |

### Other Important Tables

- **Binary**: Contains embedded binary data, including executable code
- **File**: Lists all files to be installed on the target system
- **Registry**: Defines registry modifications
- **ServiceInstall**: Configures Windows services to be installed
- **Directory**: Defines the installation directory structure
- **Component**: Defines the basic units of installation

## Common High-Impact Operations

The following operations deserve special security scrutiny:

### Executing External Applications

- **Impact**: Allows arbitrary code execution
- **Table**: `CustomAction`, `Binary`
- **Indicators**: Type values 2, 18, 34, 50 in CustomAction table
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL

### Running Scripts (VBScript, JavaScript, PowerShell)

- **Impact**: Allows arbitrary code execution
- **Table**: `CustomAction`, `Binary`
- **Indicators**: Type values 5, 6, 21, 22, 37, 38, 53, 54
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL

### Loading DLLs/COM Objects

- **Impact**: Can execute arbitrary native code
- **Table**: `CustomAction`, `Binary`
- **Indicators**: Type values 1, 17, 33, 49
- **Risk Level**: HIGH

### Setting System Properties

- **Impact**: Can influence system behavior
- **Table**: `CustomAction`
- **Indicators**: Type values 51, 35
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM

### Registry Modifications

- **Impact**: Can alter system configuration or establish persistence
- **Indicators**: Registry table entries with HKLM or Run keys
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH

### Service Installation

- **Impact**: Can create persistent background processes
- **Table**: `ServiceInstall`
- **Risk Level**: HIGH

## How to Analyze an MSI Installation Flow

1. Examine the `InstallExecuteSequence` table to understand the order of operations
2. Identify any custom actions in the sequence
3. For each custom action, check the `CustomAction` table to understand:
   - What type of action it is
   - Where the code comes from
   - What parameters are passed to it
4. Look for high-impact operations that modify the system in significant ways
5. Correlate actions with other tables to understand their full context

## Red Flags in MSI Workflow Analysis

- Custom actions with elevated privileges (Type & 0x1000)
- Actions running external executables or scripts
- Registry modifications to autorun locations
- Files being installed to sensitive system locations
- Custom actions with obfuscated parameters
- Conditions designed to hide actions in certain environments
