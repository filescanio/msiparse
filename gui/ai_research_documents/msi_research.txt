Analysis of Correlations within the MSI File Format
1. Introduction to the MSI File Format and its Structure
1.1. Overview of the Windows Installer and the Role of MSI Files
The Microsoft Installer (MSI), formerly known as Microsoft Installer with the codename Darwin, serves as a fundamental software component and application programming interface (API) within Microsoft Windows operating systems. Its primary function is to manage the complete lifecycle of software applications, encompassing installation, maintenance, and removal 1. The information necessary for these operations, along with optional payload files, is contained within installation packages. These packages, commonly known as MSI files due to their default filename extension, are structured as loosely relational databases built upon the COM Structured Storage format 1. This design provides a standardized and structured methodology for deploying software onto Windows systems. The evolution of MSI from earlier setup APIs signifies a continuous effort by Microsoft to develop a more robust and dependable framework for software installation 2. This progression suggests an underlying architecture that is likely complex and potentially composed of several layers. Furthermore, given that MSI is an API, interactions with this file format are often conducted programmatically, underscoring the importance of a thorough understanding of its internal data structures for effective manipulation or detailed analysis.
1.2. Explanation of the COM Structured Storage Foundation of MSI Files
MSI files are built upon the foundation of COM Structured Storage, a technology developed by Microsoft to enable the storage of hierarchical data within a single file. This technology is also referred to as OLE structured storage 1. This underlying structure allows an MSI file to function somewhat like a miniature file system contained within a single file, organizing data into storages, which are analogous to directories, and streams, which are similar to individual files 8. The designated internet media type for MSI files is application/x-ole-storage 1. The utilization of COM Structured Storage offers an inherent method for logically separating different categories of data within the MSI package 10. It is noteworthy that COM Structured Storage is also employed by older Microsoft Office document formats, indicating a mature and well-established technology, although it may present certain limitations, such as the file not automatically shrinking in size after data deletion 10. The comparison of storages and streams to the familiar concepts of directories and files provides a valuable conceptual framework for comprehending the organization of information within the MSI file.
1.3. Introduction to the Relational Database Structure within the MSI File
At the core of every MSI file resides a relational database, which is composed of numerous interconnected tables 4. These tables serve as repositories for all the essential information required to install, maintain, and subsequently remove the associated software application 4. The tables within this database are not isolated entities; instead, they are intricately linked to one another through well-defined primary and foreign key relationships 4. This relational structure enables an efficient method for organizing and querying the installation data, which is essential for the installer to effectively manage potentially complex installation scenarios. The existence of these primary key - foreign key relationships is fundamental to understanding the intricate correlations within the MSI file. Identifying and analyzing these relationships will be a central focus of this report.
2. Detailed Examination of MSI Streams
2.1. Types of Streams Commonly Found in MSI Files
Within the structure of an MSI file, several types of streams are commonly encountered, each serving a distinct purpose. The !Database stream stands out as a primary component, as it encapsulates the entire relational database, including all its constituent tables 8. Another significant stream is the Binary stream, which is utilized to store binary data directly within the MSI file. This often includes resources such as icons, bitmaps, animations, and scripts for custom actions 4. To optimize storage space, MSI files employ a String Pool stream. This stream contains a single instance of each unique string used throughout the database tables. Instead of repeatedly storing the same string, the tables reference these strings using integer offsets into the String Pool 10. Additionally, MSI packages frequently include streams that hold cabinet (CAB) files. These CAB files typically contain the actual application files that are intended to be installed on the target system 1. Beyond these common streams, an MSI file might also contain other streams tailored for specific needs. For instance, in some cases, particularly with potentially malicious MSI files, streams may contain embedded executable files or dynamic link libraries (DLLs) 8. Furthermore, a _Streams table exists within the database, which itself lists the various embedded OLE data streams present in the MSI file 18. The separation of the database structure, binary resources, and textual data into distinct streams suggests a design philosophy centered on modularity and efficient resource management. The use of the String Pool is a notable optimization in this regard. The inclusion of CAB files and the potential for embedded executables within streams highlight the MSI file's role as a comprehensive container for all the necessary components of a software installation.
2.2. Purpose and Content of Key Streams and their Relationship to the Database Tables
The !Database stream serves as the central repository for the entire MSI database. It contains both the schema, which defines the structure of the tables, and the actual data populating those tables. The tables themselves are responsible for defining the organization and structure of all the information related to the installation process. The content of the Binary stream, which includes elements like icons, custom action scripts, and other binary resources, is often referenced by various tables within the database. Tables such as Icon and CustomAction utilize keys or identifiers to point to specific data stored in the Binary stream 4. For instance, a record in the CustomAction table might contain a field that specifies the identifier of a binary stored in the Binary stream, which represents the code to be executed during the custom action. The String Pool stream plays a crucial role in providing the actual textual content for many fields found in the database tables. Instead of storing the same text string repeatedly across numerous rows or even different tables, the database utilizes integer offsets that point to the corresponding entry within the String Pool 10. This mechanism is vital for interpreting the content of text-based columns within the MSI tables. Streams containing CAB files hold the main application files that are to be installed on the user's system. The File table, located within the database, stores metadata about these files. This metadata includes details such as the file names, their sizes, and their intended destination locations on the target system 4. In essence, the File table functions as an index for the files that are either compressed within CAB streams or located externally. Lastly, the _Streams table itself contains information about the other embedded streams present in the MSI file, including their names and binary data, effectively acting as a metadata table for the streams themselves 18. The streams and the tables within an MSI file exhibit a close and interdependent relationship. The tables define the "what" and "where" of the installation process, specifying the components to be installed and their target locations. Conversely, the streams provide the "how" by containing the executable logic in scripts and the actual "content" in the form of application files and user interface elements. Therefore, to gain a comprehensive understanding of an MSI package, it is essential to analyze the relationships between the identifiers found in the tables and the names or indices of the data stored within the various streams.
3. In-depth Analysis of Core MSI Tables
3.1. Comprehensive Overview of Essential MSI Tables
A fundamental component of the MSI file format is the collection of tables that constitute its relational database. Several tables are particularly essential for understanding the installation process. The File Table is crucial as it contains a comprehensive list of all the source files that are intended to be installed on the target system. For each file, this table specifies various attributes, such as its name, size, version, and the component to which it belongs 4. The Component Table is another foundational table that defines the logical units of the application being installed. It serves as a central point of reference, linking together files, registry entries, shortcuts, and other resources. The Component Table is also the basis for managing conditional installations and the uninstallation process 4. The Feature Table provides a high-level perspective, defining the distinct features of the application that are presented to the user and can be selected for installation 2. The Directory Table is responsible for specifying the complete directory structure that will be created on the user's system during the installation 4. For managing system settings, the Registry Table contains detailed information about registry keys and values that need to be created or modified as part of the installation process 4. To provide easy access to the installed application, the Shortcut Table defines the shortcuts that will be created in various locations on the user's system, such as the desktop or the Start Menu 4. For more complex installation scenarios, the CustomAction Table allows the integration of custom actions, which can include executing scripts, launching external programs, or calling functions within DLLs 4. Finally, the InstallExecuteSequence Table is critical as it dictates the precise order in which the various actions, both standard and custom, are performed during a typical installation process 4. These tables collectively form the essential building blocks of an MSI package, with each table responsible for a specific facet of the software installation. A thorough understanding of their individual roles is a prerequisite for analyzing their intricate interrelationships.
3.2. Detailed Description of Each Table's Schema, Including Key Columns and their Data Types
To effectively analyze the correlations between MSI tables, it is necessary to understand the schema of each key table, including its columns and their respective data types.
For the File Table 19:

* Condition (Condition): This optional column contains a conditional expression that must evaluate to true for the action to be executed.
* Sequence (Integer): This column specifies the order in which the actions are executed.
The data types of these columns are significant as they dictate the kind of information stored and how it can be used to establish relationships with other tables. For instance, the Formatted data type allows for the inclusion of property expressions that are evaluated at runtime 46.
3.3. Identification of Primary and Foreign Key Relationships within Individual Tables
Within each of the core MSI tables, specific columns serve as primary keys, uniquely identifying each row, while other columns act as foreign keys, establishing links to other tables or even within the same table.
In the File Table, the File column is the primary key, ensuring that each file entry has a unique identifier 19. The Component_ column acts as a foreign key, referencing the Component column in the Component Table, thus linking each file to the component that manages its installation 19.
In the Component Table, the Component column is the primary key, providing a unique identifier for every component 13. The Directory_ column is a foreign key that references the Directory column in the Directory Table, specifying the installation directory for the component's resources 13.
The Feature Table uses the Feature column as its primary key, uniquely identifying each feature 13. The Feature_Parent column is a foreign key that references the Feature column within the same table, enabling the creation of hierarchical feature structures 13.
In the Directory Table, the Directory column serves as the primary key, uniquely identifying each directory entry 13. The Directory_Parent column is a foreign key that references the Directory column in the same table, allowing the definition of a directory tree 13.
The Registry Table uses the RegKey column as its primary key, ensuring the uniqueness of each registry entry 19. The Component_ column is a foreign key that references the Component column in the Component Table, linking the registry operation to a specific component 19.
In the Shortcut Table, the Shortcut column is the primary key, providing a unique identifier for each shortcut 37. The Directory_ column is a foreign key referencing the Directory column in the Directory Table, indicating where the shortcut will be created 37. The Component_ column is a foreign key that references the Component column in the Component Table, linking the shortcut to a specific component 37.
The CustomAction Table uses the Action column as its primary key, uniquely identifying each custom action 4. The Source column can act as a foreign key, potentially referencing the Name column in the Binary Table for embedded binary data 8.
In the InstallExecuteSequence Table, the Action column is a foreign key that references the Action column in the CustomAction Table or represents a standard action 4.
Understanding these primary and foreign key relationships within individual tables is crucial for grasping the internal organization and constraints of each table. For instance, the fact that Component_ in the File Table is a foreign key immediately reveals that every file must be associated with a component.
4. Establishing Correlations Between MSI Tables
4.1. Detailed Analysis of the Relationships Between Key Tables Through Primary and Foreign Key Constraints
The intricate relationships between the core MSI tables are primarily defined through primary and foreign key constraints. These relationships are fundamental to understanding how the different pieces of installation information are connected and how the installer maintains data integrity.
The File Table exhibits a one-to-many relationship with the Component Table. The Component_ column in the File Table, a foreign key, references the Component primary key in the Component Table 19. This indicates that a single component can be associated with multiple files, but each file must belong to exactly one component.
Similarly, the Registry Table has a one-to-many relationship with the Component Table. The Component_ foreign key in the Registry Table points to the Component primary key in the Component Table 19. This signifies that a component can manage multiple registry entries, but each registry entry is controlled by a single component.
The Shortcut Table also demonstrates a one-to-many relationship with the Component Table. The Component_ foreign key in the Shortcut Table references the Component primary key in the Component Table 37. Additionally, the Directory_ column in the Shortcut Table, a foreign key, references the Directory primary key in the Directory Table, establishing where the shortcut will be created 37.
The FeatureComponents Table plays a crucial role in establishing a many-to-many relationship between the Feature Table and the Component Table. Its Feature_ column, a foreign key, references the Feature primary key in the Feature Table, while its Component_ column, also a foreign key, references the Component primary key in the Component Table 4. This relationship allows a single feature to include multiple components, and a single component to be part of multiple features.
The CustomAction Table can have a one-to-many relationship with the Binary Table. The Source column in the CustomAction Table may contain a foreign key, often named BinaryKey, that references the Name primary key in the Binary Table 8. This link indicates that a custom action might utilize binary data, such as a script or an embedded executable, stored in the Binary stream.
Finally, the InstallExecuteSequence Table has a one-to-many relationship with the CustomAction Table. The Action column in the InstallExecuteSequence Table, a foreign key, references the Action primary key in the CustomAction Table or represents a standard installation action 4. This relationship dictates the order in which custom and standard actions are executed during the installation process.
These primary key - foreign key relationships form the fundamental structure of the MSI database, defining how various aspects of the installation package are interconnected and ensuring the consistency and integrity of the installation process.
4.2. Illustrative Examples of How Data in One Table Relates to Data in Other Tables
To illustrate how the relationships between MSI tables function in practice, consider the scenario where a user selects a specific feature to be installed. First, the Feature Table is consulted to identify the selected feature based on its unique Feature identifier. Next, the FeatureComponents Table is examined. Using the Feature identifier from the Feature Table, the FeatureComponents Table lists all the Component identifiers that are part of the selected feature. For each Component identifier found in the FeatureComponents Table, the Component Table is then referenced. The Component Table provides detailed information about each component, such as its Directory_ (the target installation directory obtained by looking up the identifier in the Directory Table) and its KeyPath (a specific file, registry entry, or other resource used to determine the component's installation state). Subsequently, the File Table is consulted, using the Component identifier as a foreign key in the Component_ column. This table lists all the files associated with each component, along with their names, sizes, and attributes. The Directory_ identifier from the Component Table is then used to determine the final installation path for these files by looking it up in the Directory Table.
Another example involves registry operations. A row in the Registry Table specifies a particular registry key and value to be created or modified. The Component_ foreign key in this row links it to a specific component in the Component Table. This ensures that the registry operation is only performed when the associated component is installed. The Root column in the Registry Table specifies the main registry hive (e.g., HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE), and the Key and Name columns define the specific location and name of the registry value to be written, with the actual data being stored in the Value column.
These examples demonstrate how the primary and foreign key relationships between different MSI tables enable the installer to manage complex installation tasks by linking together information about features, components, files, directories, and system settings.
4.3. Explanation of How These Relationships Define the Logical Structure of the Installation Package
The intricate network of relationships between the MSI tables defines the complete logical structure of the software installation package. Features, as defined in the Feature Table, represent logical groupings of application functionality from the user's perspective. These features are then linked to specific components through the FeatureComponents Table. Components, detailed in the Component Table, are the fundamental units of deployment, each containing a collection of resources such as files, registry entries, and shortcuts. The actual files that make up these components are listed in the File Table, while the Directory Table establishes the hierarchical structure of directories on the target system where these files will be installed. System settings, such as registry modifications, are managed through the Registry Table, and user access points like shortcuts are defined in the Shortcut Table.
This structured approach allows the MSI format to abstract the installation process. For instance, users can choose to install or uninstall specific features, and the installer, by following the relationships defined in the Feature Table and FeatureComponents Table, ensures that all the necessary underlying components and their associated resources (files, registry entries, etc.) are correctly managed. This modularity also enables features and components to be shared across different parts of the application or even among different applications, promoting efficiency and consistency. The use of primary and foreign keys ensures referential integrity across these tables, guaranteeing that the installation process remains coherent and that all dependencies are properly handled.

	5. Analyzing Installation Sequences and Actions through Table Relationships
5.1. Explanation of the Role of Sequence Tables (InstallUISequence, InstallExecuteSequence) in the Installation Process
The sequence of operations during an MSI-based installation is meticulously controlled by sequence tables, primarily the InstallUISequence and the InstallExecuteSequence 4. These tables dictate the precise order in which various actions are performed throughout the installation lifecycle. The InstallUISequence table is specifically responsible for managing the steps and the user interface elements that are presented to the user during the interactive phase of the installation. It defines the flow of dialog boxes, user prompts, and other UI-related events. On the other hand, the InstallExecuteSequence table governs the actual operations that modify the system, such as copying files, writing to the registry, and creating shortcuts 4. Both of these sequence tables share a similar structure, containing columns such as Action, Condition, and Sequence 4. The Action column specifies the particular operation to be performed, which can be either a standard action predefined by the Windows Installer or a custom action defined in the CustomAction table. The Sequence column determines the order in which these actions are executed; actions with lower sequence numbers are performed earlier in the installation process. The Condition column contains an optional conditional expression. If a condition is present, it must evaluate to true for the associated action to be executed. If no condition is specified or if the condition evaluates to true, the action will be performed when its sequence number is reached. These sequence tables are crucial for understanding the dynamic behavior of the installer, as they orchestrate the execution of various tasks and determine how the data stored in other MSI tables is ultimately applied to the target system.
5.2. How Actions (Standard and Custom) Defined in the CustomAction Table Interact with Other Tables Like File, Registry, and Binary
The CustomAction table serves as a central registry for both standard actions, which are built-in functionalities provided by the Windows Installer, and custom actions, which are specific operations defined by the author of the MSI package 4. Custom actions offer a mechanism to extend the capabilities of the standard installer by allowing the execution of scripts, launching of external executables, or calls to functions within dynamic link libraries (DLLs) 4. The code or data for these custom actions can be stored in various locations. For instance, scripts are often embedded within the MSI file as binary data and stored in the Binary stream. The CustomAction table might contain a reference, typically through a column like Source or BinaryKey, to the specific entry in the Binary stream that holds the script to be executed 8. Similarly, if a custom action involves launching an executable, the Target column in the CustomAction table might specify the path to an executable file. This path could refer to a file that is intended to be installed as part of the application, in which case the path would likely involve a property that resolves to a location defined by the Directory Table and the File Table. If the executable itself is embedded within the MSI, the Target column might again reference an entry in the Binary stream. Standard actions also interact extensively with other MSI tables. For example, the InstallFiles standard action relies on the information provided in the File Table to determine which files need to be copied to the target system and from where they should be sourced. The destination directories for these files are ultimately determined by the relationships between the File Table, the Component Table, and the Directory Table. Another standard action, WriteRegistryValues, directly utilizes the data stored in the Registry Table to create or modify registry entries on the user's system 4. Likewise, the CreateShortcuts standard action uses the information in the Shortcut Table to generate shortcuts in the appropriate locations, as specified by the relationships with the Directory and Component tables 4. In essence, the CustomAction table acts as a crucial link between the declarative data held within the various MSI tables and the imperative execution logic that drives the installation process. Understanding the types and configurations of both standard and custom actions is therefore essential for a comprehensive analysis of an MSI package's behavior.
5.3. Tracing the Flow of the Installation Process by Following the Relationships Between Sequence Tables, Actions, and the Data in Other Relevant Tables
To understand the step-by-step execution of an MSI installation, it is necessary to examine the InstallExecuteSequence table. Each row in this table represents an action to be performed during the installation, along with a specified sequence number and an optional condition 4. The Action column in each row refers to either a standard action (a built-in installer function) or a custom action that is defined in the CustomAction table. The Sequence number dictates the order of execution; actions with lower sequence numbers are executed before those with higher numbers. The Condition column contains an expression that is evaluated at runtime. If this condition evaluates to true (or if the condition column is empty), the corresponding action is executed when its sequence number is reached.
To trace the installation flow, one would start by examining the InstallExecuteSequence table and following the actions in the order of their sequence numbers. For each action listed, it's important to determine whether it's a standard action or a custom action. If it's a custom action, the corresponding entry in the CustomAction table should be examined to understand what operation it performs (e.g., executing a script, launching an executable).
For each action, whether standard or custom, the next step is to identify which other MSI tables are likely to be involved. For instance, if the action is InstallFiles, the analysis would then focus on the File Table to see which files are being installed, the Component Table to understand the logical grouping of these files, and the Directory Table to determine their destination on the target system. If the action is a custom action that executes a script, the Binary Table would be relevant as it likely contains the script's code. If the action involves writing to the registry, the Registry Table would be the focus.
By systematically following the sequence of actions in the InstallExecuteSequence table and examining the relationships between these actions and the data stored in other MSI tables, a detailed understanding of the entire installation process can be constructed. This involves tracing how the installer uses the declarative data in tables like File, Registry, and Shortcut, and how it executes both standard and custom actions in a specific order to deploy the software onto the user's system. This level of analysis is invaluable for debugging installation issues, understanding the intricacies of complex installers, and identifying potential security vulnerabilities.
6. Leveraging Tools for MSI Database Analysis
6.1. Mentioning Tools Like Orca and msitools for Inspecting MSI Database Tables and Streams
Several specialized tools are available that greatly facilitate the inspection and analysis of MSI database tables and streams. Orca, a free database editor provided by Microsoft as part of the Windows SDK, is a particularly useful tool. It allows users to directly open and view the contents of MSI files in a tabular format, making it easy to examine the schema and data within each table 3. Orca also enables the editing of MSI files, though this should be done with caution and a thorough understanding of the MSI format. For users working in a Linux environment, the msitools package offers a suite of command-line utilities, including msiinfo and msidump. msiinfo can be used to list the tables and streams contained within an MSI file, providing a high-level overview of its structure 4. msidump allows for the extraction of the contents of both tables and streams, enabling a more detailed examination of the data 4. Beyond these dedicated MSI analysis tools, general-purpose archiving utilities like 7-Zip can also be helpful. 7-Zip can often open MSI files and extract their contents, including the various streams they contain, which can then be analyzed separately 5. Another powerful tool for analyzing OLE files, including MSI files, is oledump.py, a Python script. oledump.py can be used to examine the streams within an MSI file, and it has the capability to decode the often-obfuscated names of these streams, providing valuable clues about their purpose 8. Additionally, commercial software packaging tools like Advanced Installer also provide features for browsing and editing MSI files, often with a more user-friendly graphical interface 3. These tools collectively offer a range of capabilities for examining the internal structure and content of MSI files, catering to different operating systems and levels of technical expertise.
6.2. Briefly Discussing How These Tools Can Aid in Identifying Correlations
These analysis tools play a crucial role in the process of identifying correlations within MSI files. Orca's table view provides a direct way to visualize the data in each table, making it easier to spot primary and foreign key relationships. By examining the column definitions and the actual data, users can often infer how different tables are linked. For instance, seeing a column named Component_ in one table and a column named Component in another strongly suggests a foreign key relationship. msiinfo's ability to list all tables and streams offers a preliminary understanding of the package's organization. Knowing the names of the tables and streams is the first step in understanding their potential relationships. msidump's capability to extract the content of tables allows for a more in-depth analysis of the data. By dumping the contents of related tables, one can manually trace the links between rows based on shared identifiers that act as primary and foreign keys. For example, by dumping the File Table and the Component Table, one can see how the Component_ value in the File Table corresponds to the Component value in the Component Table, thus confirming their relationship. oledump.py's ability to decode stream names can provide valuable context about the purpose of different streams. For instance, a stream named "Binary.CustomActionDll" strongly indicates that this stream likely contains a DLL that is used by a custom action defined in the CustomAction table. By using these tools in combination, analysts can effectively navigate the MSI database and examine the contents of its tables and streams, enabling them to manually trace the relationships and correlations that define the structure and behavior of the installation package. Hands-on experience with these tools is essential for practical reverse engineering of MSI files and for validating the theoretical understanding of the format.
7. Conclusion and Further Analysis
7.1. Summary of the Key Correlations Identified Between the MSI Database Tables and Streams
The analysis reveals a highly structured and interconnected architecture within the MSI file format. The core of this format is a relational database comprised of numerous tables that store all the necessary information for software installation, maintenance, and removal. These tables, including the File, Component, Feature, Directory, Registry, Shortcut, and CustomAction tables, are linked together through primary and foreign key relationships, forming a logical framework that governs the entire installation process. The InstallExecuteSequence table orchestrates the execution of both standard and custom actions, which in turn interact with the data in these core tables. Streams within the MSI file, such as the !Database stream, the Binary stream, the String Pool, and CAB file streams, provide the underlying data and resources that the tables reference. The !Database stream houses the tables themselves, the Binary stream stores binary resources like scripts and icons, the String Pool optimizes storage of textual data, and CAB streams contain the application's files. The relationships between these tables and streams are crucial for the installer to perform its tasks correctly, ensuring that the right files are installed in the right locations, registry settings are properly configured, and shortcuts are created as intended.
7.2. Recommendations for Further In-depth Analysis Based on the Identified Relationships
Building upon the identified correlations, several avenues for further in-depth analysis can be explored. A detailed examination of the conditions specified in the sequence tables, particularly the InstallExecuteSequence table, would provide deeper insights into the complex installation logic and decision-making processes embedded within the MSI package. Analyzing custom actions and their interactions with embedded binaries or scripts, potentially by extracting and decompiling or disassembling these resources, could reveal application-specific installation steps and any potentially malicious behavior. Utilizing tools like Orca, msitools, and oledump to examine real-world MSI files and apply the knowledge gained from this analysis would provide practical experience and validate the theoretical understanding of the format. Investigating the use of properties, which are defined in the Property table or set dynamically during the installation, and how they influence the installation flow and the data within the tables could uncover further layers of complexity and customization. Finally, exploring the Merge Module (MSM) format and its relationship to MSI packages would provide a broader understanding of how modular installation components are managed and integrated. These further steps will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the intricacies of the MSI file format and its role in software deployment.
